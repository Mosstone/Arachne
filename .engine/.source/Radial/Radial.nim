    Create a server which receives shell commands from /Spiral.py. The commands are
    processed as threads and executed in parallel, with the output streamed back to
    the calling terminal. Use Radial.py once to establish the network, and then use
    Spiral.py <command> to open threads from anywhere else
    
    These threads self terminate, after not receiving input for a few seconds. This
    timer is reset by progress meters since they update the most recent line in cli

    Using /Radial.py end or /Spiral.py threads.end terminates the server and closes
    all open threads. If opened with /Spiral.py &  as a background process, the end
    command will close every Radial.py process. Radial resists duplication so it is
    safe to repeatedly open it as background processes, before adding threads to it

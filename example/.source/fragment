    A part of these commands are derived from
    a file and assembled in the json directly
    using a subshell. This can be used to add
    visible metadata without affecting script
    execution, or replacing its output with a
    progress meter or other information

    Logic can also be inserted to control the
    pane behaviour when it finishes execution
    and when to exit. Without an exit command
    the panes will wait for the controller to
    close the server. To close the server use
    tmux kill-session, and it will not affect
    any other sessions in arachne or tmux


    Commands in excess of 11 will be moved to
    background windows in the session so they
    still execute in the same manner. Calling
    tmux kill-session from those still closes
    the process normally. The only difference
    is that the first eleven jobs in the json
    have visible user feedback
